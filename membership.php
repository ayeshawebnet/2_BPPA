Surviving in a society that accords massive opportunities and challenges, survival can be stressful especially with dignity and parity. There is a constant need for everyone to be part of a larger, vocal, support network, like a union, a spokes-body for one’s aspirations, protection and assistance. That was why the trade union movement started. That was why human beings chose to live in groups and had alliances with each other. British Pakistani psychiatrists needed to have such alliances and representation. However, there was the desire but there was neither time nor resources to build this support network. Of course some attempts were made but those collapsed due to internal conflicts and divisions. Yet, there were always opportunities to meet at various conferences and forums, periodically, which gave us- British Pakistani psychiatrists, a sense of camaraderie and support.
